## 📋 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Duplicate, Google chose different canonical than user
- **URL:** `https://www.pdfhubs.site/`
- **Cause:** Missing canonical tag, URL inconsistency (with/without trailing slash)
- **Impact:** Google couldn't determine preferred URL version
- **Fixed:** Added canonical tag, standardized on trailing slash

### 2. ✅ Alternate page with proper canonical tag  
- **URL:** `https://www.pdfhubs.site/?q={search_term_string}`
- **Cause:** SearchAction in structured data without actual search functionality
- **Impact:** Google tried to crawl template URL as real page
- **Fixed:** Removed SearchAction schema, added redirect rule

potentialAction
?q={search_term_string}
```

### 2. Test Redirect

## 💡 Key Learnings

### What We Fixed:
1. **Always use trailing slashes consistently** everywhere
2. **Only add SearchAction if you have real search functionality**
3. **Include canonical tags in static HTML**, not just JS
4. **Use redirects to prevent duplicate content**

### Best Practices Going Forward:
- ✅ Keep URL format consistent (always use trailing slash for pages)
- ✅ Match URLs in: canonical, sitemap, structured data, social tags
- ✅ Test structured data before deploying
- ✅ Monitor Google Search Console weekly
- ✅ Request re-indexing after major SEO changes
